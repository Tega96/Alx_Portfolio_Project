Introduction
  include banner image ie, screeshot or a logo of your appllication
  Define the purpose of your project
  Share your team members, roles and timeline
      Example: our project helps bicyclist find a route with te least elevation between two points in NIgeria
      Our team members are John Smith, Jane Doe, and myself. As an engineerin problem, we wanted to focus on 2 
      things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also souring a reliable 
      and sophisticate API. John worked on [XYZ], Jane and I worked on [ABC]

Tell a Story about yourself which relates to why you chose to work on this project
      Example: Everyone on our team enjoys riding bicyles, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon. For me, 
      I grew up in a small town surrounded by farms and forests. My best friend lives in the next town over and the
      only way i could visit her was by riding my bicle. On weekends, and holiday breaks, i would get up at the break of dawn and bike for over an hour to my friend's place. The road i took was lined by corn fields on both sides with the sun rising on the left. Whenever i bike in the city now, it brings back these hours i spent chasing the brightening horizon at dawn with the smellof the harvest around me. I hope to ake bicycling more accessible so that more poeple, especially city people, can learn the joy that bicyling can bring to their lives.
